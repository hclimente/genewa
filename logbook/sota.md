We want to compile a list of existing tools to detect epistasis. Firstly, we want to test the performance of existing tools. Not only under the lenses of accuracy and type I errors, but also of **stability** ie how robust are the results. In order to do this, we will sample our simulated data and compare the results (eg correlation between the p-values among the different runs). Secondly, we want to test how different simulation settings affect the outcome. For example, what are the lower boundaries of incidence to detect epistasis.

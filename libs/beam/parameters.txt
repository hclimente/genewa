[RUNNING PARAMETER]
CHAIN					100							//number of MCMC chains
BURNIN				0					//number of burnin updates
MCMC				0				//number of updates after burnin
THIN					INSERT_THIN					//number of updates between two posterior samples; Recommended: = number of markers
PRIOR1				0.01					//prior probability for each marker to belong to group 1 (marginal group)
PRIOR2				0.01					//prior probability for each marker to belong to group 2 (interacting group)
SINGLE_ONLY		0							//1: test for marginal associations only; 0: test for both marginal and interaction associatoin
MINDISTANCE		0				//let BEAM to detect interaction between SNPs that are at least MINDISTANCE bps apart
INITIALTRYS		20						//if set to 0, the chains will run from random starting points, with annealing;
														//if set to a positive integer (x), we first search for x good starting points, and then run chains from these points, without annealing.
TRY_LENGTH		0						//this is a multiplier (x) that determines how long each trial will run. For L markers, each trial runs for xL iterations.
AUTORESTART		5							//during MCMC, whenever max(LogP) is larger than initial(LogP) + AUTORESTART, then MCMC restarts from this "better" mode.
														//this should be a positive number. to disable autorestart, set this value high (e.g., 1000000)

[INPUT FORMAT]
INPFILE				INSERT_INPUT		//input file name for case-control data

INC_SNP_POS		0							//input file includes SNP locations (in bytes), e.g., Chr10  1042329

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
OUTFILE				INSERT_OUTPUT	//output file name for posterior distributions and detected associations

In this repository, we evaluate six network-based GWAS tools on the [GENESIS dataset](http://bmccancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12885-015-2028-9). It containts the accompanying scripts, results, and laboratory notebooks of the following article:

> Climente-Gonz√°lez H, Lonjou C, Lesueur F, GENESIS study group, Stoppa-Lyonnet D, et al. (2021) **Boosting GWAS using biological networks: A study on susceptibility to familial breast cancer.** PLOS Computational Biology 17(3): e1008819. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008819

This repository is organized into four main subfolders:

- [scripts/](scripts): contains the mai pieces code using to run the experiments.
- [results/](results): contains the results of the experiments. Generally, every subfolder contains a script `run.sh` which, upon running, produced all the files within that directory.
- [doc/](doc): contains the Jupyter notebooks in which the results are analyzed (see [below](#analyses)).

# Choice of simulation tool

NIH has a [nice comparative](https://popmodels.cancercontrol.cancer.gov/gsr/search/) of genome simulation tools. We filtered by the following criteria:

* Select those that have a GSR Certification, which has is interesting from both documentation and support perspectives.
* Tested in Linux
* Type of Simulated Data is Genotype at Genetic Markers.
* Phenotype is determined by Gene-Gene Interaction.

Two well documented tools emerge [simuPOP](http://simupop.sourceforge.net) and [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/). While the former one has a Python interface, the latter has a ad hoc scripting language. Hence, the first one looks more interesting.

## simuPOP + simuGWAS + GENS2
